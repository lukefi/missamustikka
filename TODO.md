* Using ground elevation model http://www.maanmittauslaitos.fi/en/maps-and-spatial-data/expert-users/product-descriptions/elevation-model-10-m
  to improve accuracy for some berries.
* Using the population grid http://www.stat.fi/tup/rajapintapalvelut/vaestoruutuaineisto_1km_en.html to estimate how quickly the berries are
  picked on different areas. Near densely populated areas there will likely be not much berries left at the end of the season.
