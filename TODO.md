# Data

* Using ground elevation model http://www.maanmittauslaitos.fi/en/maps-and-spatial-data/expert-users/product-descriptions/elevation-model-10-m
  to improve accuracy for some berries.
* Using the population grid http://www.stat.fi/tup/rajapintapalvelut/vaestoruutuaineisto_1km_en.html to estimate how quickly the berries are
  picked on different areas. Near densely populated areas there will likely be not much berries left at the end of the season.
* Very small berry sites (single 20m x 20m pixel far away from others) could be removed.

# User interface

* Remember and restore the map view parameters when switching between berry species.
* Add information on times when specific berries are usually picked (this depends also on geographic location). Highlight species that could
  be picked right now.
